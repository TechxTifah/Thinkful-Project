    I made the decision to pursue a career in the tech during the global pandemic of 2020. I wanted to pivot into a field that I knew would be fun, challenging, and fullfilling. In addition, I wanted a career that would grant me a healthy work-life balance. I look forward to learning and growing with an
    amazing team at an awesome company.
